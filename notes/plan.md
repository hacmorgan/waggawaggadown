# Story
## Intro
Start at home, learn controls while finding panko

The player starts by waking up at our house, _very_ briefly asks "where is everyone?", and hears panko borking in the causeway. Auto pick up bow and machete (print small notification)

Panko is in causeway, borking at 3 zombies. Get them with bow to unlock panko and unlimited ammo slingshot

Panko says (yes he can talk) that cato ran in the direction of the rules club.

## 1st mission
Find Cato

Cato is invulnerable to damage but takes a little while to recharge. His attack inflicts strong damage

As the player runs along glenfield road, zombies should spawn 

# Development requirements
## Graphics
### Maps
Need to take multiple high resolution screenshots of google maps.

Likely need corresponding PNG masks (lossless compression is important) to designate walls, doors, and entranceways to buildings.

### Spaces (stretch goal)
It would be nice to be able to enter and leave buildings, e.g. for boss battles.
- Home
- Maccas
- Rules club
- Bunnings

### Vehicles (stretch goal)
It would also be nice to be able to use vehicles (which should probably respawn)

### Sprites
Each sprite will need a front view (for when you unlock them) and a top view for in-game. Where possible, sprites should come from open repositories
- Player (Em)
- Panko
- Cato
- Zombies

## Software
### UI
- Conversation mechanism
- Thought bubbles (maybe same as above)
- Current objective (preferrably hideable)
